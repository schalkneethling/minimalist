## Ways to Contribute

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#ways-to-contribute)

We welcome many different types of contributions including:

* New features
* Builds, CI/CD
* Bug fixes
* Documentation
* Issue Triage
* Answering questions on Slack/Mailing List
* Web design
* Communications / Social Media / Blog Posts
* Release management

Not everything happens through a GitHub pull request. Please come to our
[meetings](TODO) or [contact us](TODO) and let's discuss how we can work
together. 

### Come to Meetings

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#come-to-meetings)

Absolutely everyone is welcome to come to any of our meetings. You never need an
invite to join us. In fact, we want you to join us, even if you don‚Äôt have
anything you feel like you want to contribute. Just being there is enough!

You can find out more about our meetings [here](TODO). You don‚Äôt have to turn on
your video. The first time you come, introducing yourself is more than enough.
Over time, we hope that you feel comfortable voicing your opinions, giving
feedback on others‚Äô ideas, and even sharing your own ideas, and experiences.

## Find an Issue

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#find-an-issue)

We have good first issues for new contributors and help wanted issues suitable
for any contributor. [good first issue](TODO) has extra information to
help you make your first contribution. [help wanted](TODO) are issues
suitable for someone who isn't a core maintainer and is good to move onto after
your first pull request.

Sometimes there won‚Äôt be any issues with these labels. That‚Äôs ok! There is
likely still something for you to work on. If you want to contribute but you
don‚Äôt know where to start or can't find a suitable issue, you can **explain how people can ask for an issue to work on**.

Once you see an issue that you'd like to work on, please post a comment saying
that you want to work on it. Something like "I want to work on this" is fine.

## Ask for Help

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#ask-for-help)

The best way to reach us with a question when contributing is to ask on:

‚ö†Ô∏è **Pick the way(s) that you prefer people ask for help**

* The original github issue
* The developer mailing list
* Our Slack channel
