# Introduction to Minimalist

**Minimalist** is a lightweight and modern CSS library designed to provide a simple yet elegant foundation for styling base HTML elements. It serves as a starting point for building websites and applications, offering thoughtfully crafted styles for the elements developers encounter most frequently.

For more information on customization and supported features, consult the [official reference documentation](https://minimalist-docs.netlify.app/).

## Key Features

- **Minimal and Elegant:** Focuses on essential styles to ensure a clean and consistent visual foundation without unnecessary bloat.
- **Modern Design:** Leverages modern CSS features for better performance, flexibility, and compatibility with current development standards.
- **Customizable:** Uses namespaced CSS custom properties, allowing users to easily adjust and extend styles to fit their specific needs. Both namespaced variables and default values are thoroughly documented.
- **Lightweight:** Designed to maintain minimal complexity, size, and byte footprint, ensuring fast load times and ease of use.

## What Minimalist Is _Not_

While Minimalist includes a small number of utility classes for convenience, it is **not** a general-purpose utility library and will not evolve into one. Its focus remains on providing foundational styles, not an exhaustive set of utilities.

### Contributing to Minimalist

Minimalist is open source and welcomes community contributions. Users are encouraged to:

- Report issues and bugs.
