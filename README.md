# minimalist

A minimal pure CSS starter library for most web projects.

## Getting minimalist

You can easily add minimalist to your existing or new project using the CLI.

```bash
npm create minimalist@latest
```

You will be prompted to enter the desctination directory into which the files will be copied.
Please ensure that this is relative to your project's root folder.

All that is left is to link the CSS in your project. The `main` file you must add is `minimalist.css`.
You will fnd this in `your-target-dir/minimalist/minimalist.css`.
